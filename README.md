# projects
This repository contains projects I've done in college and outside of school (such as freelancing work and tutoring sessions). 
School work related files usually begin with the class (STOR) then the number. 
STOR 320 was Introduction to Data Science, STOR 455 was Methods of Data Analysis, STOR 590 was Advanced Linear Models
Side work and tutoring sessions are all other files. I based most of my tutoring lessons from the textbook R for Data Science and utilized almost/if not all datasets for lessons from the textbook.

Analysis College (freelance):
I conducted an analysis on child/parent data and ran chi squared tests to determine where parent's educational background was predictive of their childrens academic performance

Tidyverse Answer Key(tutoring):
I created this file to give to my student to test knowledge on the tidyverse package which involves functions such as filter selec, mutate, rename, etc. 
The answer key includes the correct answer for each of the questions-I got the dataset from one of the packages within R and created some of the questions myself

Reading Audit (freelance):
I had to clean and alter a dataset with student's literacy performance results (the dataset was unorganized and I had to convert alphabetic values into numeric) 

Joins Answer Key(tutor):
I created this file to give to my student to test knowledge on joins which involve inner join, left join, right join, etc. 
The answer key includes the correct answer for each of the questions-I got the dataset from one of the packages within R and created some of the questions myself
