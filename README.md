# projects
This repository contains projects I've done in college and outside of school (such as freelancing work and tutoring sessions). 
School work related files usually begin with the class (STOR) then the number. 
STOR 320 was Introduction to Data Science, STOR 455 was Methods of Data Analysis, STOR 590 was Advanced Linear Models
Side work and tutoring sessions are all other files. I based most of my tutoring lessons from the textbook R for Data Science and utilized almost/if not all datasets for lessons from the textbook.

---Freelance--

Analysis College:
I conducted an analysis on child/parent data and ran chi squared tests to determine where parent's educational background was predictive of their childrens academic performance

Reading Audit:
I had to clean and alter a dataset with student's literacy performance results (the dataset was unorganized and I had to convert alphabetic values into numeric) 

**unable to share some of the code I have done for freelance work in SAS and R due to privacy purposes

R Data Wrangle: 
I created this file as a lesson plan to explain how to join datasets and use the tidyverse package to manipulate information within an aviation dataset

R Session 6:
I created this file as a lesson plan to explain how to clean datasets (using a healthcare dataset)

Tidyverse Answer Key:
I created this file to test knowledge on the tidyverse package which involves functions such as filter selec, mutate, rename, etc. 
The answer key includes the correct answer for each of the questions-I got the dataset from one of the packages within R and created some of the questions myself

Joins Answer Key:
I created this file test knowledge on joins which involve inner join, left join, right join, etc. 
The answer key includes the correct answer for each of the questions-I got the dataset from one of the packages within R and created some of the questions myself

STOR 590
Hwk 1-6:
These homeworks invovled created various types of models linear models, explaining unexpected outcomes and using ggplot to create graphs to illustrate trends
Topics: Binary response models, generalized linear models: general theory and methods, Binomial and proportion models, Count regression, Contingency tables: two-way, three-way, matched pairs, ordinal variables, and Other GLMs: gamma, inverse gaus
